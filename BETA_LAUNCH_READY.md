## 📧 Beta Invite Email Template

**Subject:** You're Invited to Test TradingAgents Beta! 🚀

```
Hi [Name],

I'm excited to invite you to test TradingAgents - an AI-powered stock analysis tool I've been building.

🎯 What it does:
• Analyzes stocks using 4 specialized AI agents (Market, Fundamentals, News, Social)
• Provides buy/sell/hold recommendations with detailed reasoning
• Calculates risk and position sizing
• Shows interactive charts and visualizations
• Supports stocks, ETFs, and crypto

🔗 Try it here: https://c1-chat.onrender.com/landing

💡 Example prompts to try:
• "Analyze AAPL"
• "Should I buy TSLA?"
• "What's the risk of buying NVDA?"
• "Analyze SPY" (S&P 500 ETF)
• "Compare AAPL vs MSFT"

⚠️ Important:
- This is BETA software - expect some rough edges
- Analysis takes 30-60 seconds (running 4 AI agents)
- This is NOT financial advice - for testing and research only
- Please report any bugs or issues

📝 I need your honest feedback:

Thanks for helping me build something awesome!

P.S. Beta access is completely free. No credit card, no signup required - just click and start analyzing!

## 🐛 Common Issues & Responses

**"It's slow"**
```
Thanks for the feedback! The analysis takes 30-60 seconds because it's running 4 AI agents in parallel analyzing market data, fundamentals, news, and social sentiment. This is normal for the beta. We're working on optimizing it!
```

**"Price seems wrong"**
```
Can you tell me which stock and what price you saw? We use real-time data from MarketData.app. I'll investigate and verify the data source!
```

**"It crashed / I got an error"**
```
Sorry about that! Can you share:
1. What stock were you analyzing?
2. What was the exact error message?
3. Screenshot if possible?

This helps me fix it quickly. Thanks!
```

**"Can it analyze [feature X]?"**
```
Great suggestion! That's not in the beta yet, but I'm tracking feature requests. If multiple people want this, I'll prioritize it. Thanks for the feedback!
